{"title": "Senior Data Scientist", "company": "Walmart", "description": "Position Description\n\nA Senior Data Scientist is responsible for analyzing large data sets to develop custom models and algorithms to drive business solutions. Data Scientists work on project teams in order to provide analytical support to projects (for example, email targeting, business optimization, consumer recommendations) for Walmart. Data Scientists are responsible for building large data sets from multiple sources in order to build algorithms for predicting future data characteristics. Those algorithms will be tested, validated, and applied to large data sets. Data Scientists are responsible for training the algorithms so they can be applied to future data sets and provide the appropriate search results. Data Scientists are responsible for researching new trends in the industry and utilizing up-to-date technology and analytical skills to support their assigned project.\nBuild complex data sets from multiple data sources, both internally and externally.\nBuild learning systems to analyze and filter continuous data flows and offline data analysis.\nCombine data features to determine search models.\nConduct advanced statistical analysis to determine trends and significant data relationships.\nDemonstrates up-to-date expertise and applies this to the development, execution, and improvement of action plans\nDevelop custom data models to drive innovative business solutions.\nScale new algorithms to large data sets.\nTrain algorithms to apply models to new data sets.\nDevelop models of current state in order to determine needed improvements\nModels compliance with company policies and procedures and supports company mission, values, and standards of ethics and integrity\nProvides and supports the implementation of business solutions\nResearch new techniques and best practices within the industry.\nUtilize system tools including (Python, SQL, Hadoop, R, Matlab, ILog).\nValidate models and algorithmic techniques.\nWork with cross-functional partners across the business.\nMinimum Qualifications\n\nBachelor of Science and 5 years data science experience OR Master of Science and 2 years data science experience.\nHigh proficiency in data mining, modeling, validation and insight generation.\nExcellent working knowledge of statistics, mathematics and machine learning algorithms.\nHigh proficiency in coding languages, including Python and SQL.\nAbility to work with large data sets. Has sound understanding of big data technology stack.\nAdditional Preferred Qualifications\n\nUnderstanding of cloud computing platforms and large-scale databases\nProven ability to collaborate and work in teams\nExcellent with communications and stakeholder engagement\nData science publications in recognized platforms/journals\nProven ability to work in agile mode on data science sprint projects\nCompany Summary\n\nThe Walmart eCommerce team is rapidly innovating to evolve and define the future state of shopping. As the worldâ€™s largest retailer, we are on a mission to help people save money and live better. With the help of some of the brightest minds in technology, merchandising, marketing, supply chain, talent and more, we are reimagining the intersection of digital and physical shopping to help achieve that mission.\nPosition Summary\n\nA Senior Data Scientist is responsible for analyzing large data sets to develop custom models and algorithms to drive business solutions.
