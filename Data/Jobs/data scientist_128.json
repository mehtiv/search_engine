Codecademy has helped over 45 million people from around the world upgrade their careers with engaging, accessible, and flexible education on programming and data skills. We provide over 200 hands-on interactive lessons ranging from Python to R to Javascript and everything in between. Our learners have gone on to start companies, new jobs, and new lives thanks to what they've learned with Codecademy, and we're thrilled to be working to take that impact to the next level.\n\nCodecademy was started in 2011 by two college students in a dorm room at Columbia that were frustrated by the huge gap between education and employment. A few years later, we are a rapidly growing, diverse team of 75+ in SoHo, NYC. We've raised over $40m in venture capital funding from top investors including Union Square Ventures, Kleiner Perkins, Naspers, Y Combinator, and more.\n\nIf you want to help build a business that impacts tens of millions of people each year and helps them lead better lives, join us!\n\n--------------\nWHAT YOU'LL DO\n--------------\n\nAs a Senior Data Scientist focused on Analytics and Experimentation, you will work on an impactful team to analyze our millions of learners. We capture terabytes of data on how users engage with our platform. As Codecademy continues our rapid growth, we want to build a data-informed culture that uses hypothesis testing, experimentation, and exploratory analysis to guide our decision-making process.\n\nYou will join a small but growing team of Data Scientists. Our work is in high-demand from all corners of Codecademy. We work on a variety of problems and have a real impact on the business and product. If you have a proven background in data and you are excited about making code education accessible, we want to hear from you!\n\nApply exploratory data analysis and causal inference to answer complex questions about our users.\nCollaborate across teams to help scope out analyses, through a combination of experimentation (A/B testing) and quantitative user research.\nDesign experiments and evaluate results to test and iterate on new product ideas.\nPerform deep dives into our data to build understanding around our business.\nWork with our data science and engineering teams to maintain data integrity.\nMentor and consult with a cross-functional team of data scientists, engineers, and product managers.\n----------------\nWHAT YOU'LL NEED\n----------------\n\n4+ years of industry experience in a data science, analytics, or research role. You have strong data intuition and knowledge of using data science best practices to drive impact.\nExpert SQL - we use Redshift. Able to write clean and efficient queries on massive datasets.\nApplied experience with statistical programming languages - R or Python preferred.\nUnderstanding of statistical methods and when to use them (hypothesis testing, experiment design, sampling).\nStrong written and verbal communicator. Comfortable working with loosely defined research problems.\n----------------------------\nWHAT WILL MAKE YOU STAND OUT\n----------------------------\n\nBackground in experimentation and measurement. We're looking to streamline our experimentation reporting framework and would love your help.\nA workflow involving reproducible methods and version control - Github, Docker.\nExperience automating dashboards with business intelligence tools - Looker, Tableau.\nPassionate about teaching the world to code. Empathy for our learners, such as a background in education or past experience using our site.\n---------------------------------------\nINTERESTING QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT WORK ON\n---------------------------------------\n\nWhat are some different types of patterns in user behavior?\nWhat do we do when we are unable to conduct an experiment?\nCan we predict whether a learner will renew their subscription?\nHow do we improve the relevance of our course recommendations?\nHow can we scale our existing processes?
